description: This Low-code app development project was created leveraging Google Appsheet and Google Sheets. It aimed at helping the Operations team and the Managers to track all the Hardware and Travel Request data and documents, along with other requests. Requests data is in one place with limited access to certain features and data within the app from specific teams, employees and managers. The project was developed using Agile methodology, which involved iterative two-week sprints where I prioritized tasks based on their business value and the Operations team's feedback who are the main app user for now.
