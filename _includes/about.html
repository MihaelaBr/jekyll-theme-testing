                <p>I seek to uncover the secrets of the data I work with and sometimes engineer 
                    it's path and transformation to the vizualisation tools I use. My background is in managing technical 
                    projects and working with geospatial data and maps. Excited about anything related to Data 
                    and Web Analytics, Data Engineering and Data Science, Process automations and App development.</p>
                <p>In this Portfolio you can see a few of my data and vizualisation projects created around business 
                    topics, some that have a special focus on the urban and natural environment, and also a few that 
                    include personal interests like music and movies.</p>
                <p>My strenghts are SQL, Databases, LookML and vizualisations in most of the Business Intelligence
                    and Geo Information Systems tools but I also enjoy working on improving my Python programming, 
                    ETL/ELT and pipeline building skills as well. </p>
