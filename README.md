Personal Data Projects Portfolio Michaela Brankova
=========================

## About the Portfolio

In this Portfolio you can see a few of my data and vizualisation projects created around business topics, 
some that have a special focus on the urban and natural environment, and also a few that include personal interests like music and movies.

## About me
I seek to uncover the secrets of the data I work with and sometimes engineer it's path and transformation to the vizualisation tools I use. 
My background is in managing technical projects and working with geospatial data and maps. Excited about anything related to Data and Web Analytics, 
Data Engineering and Data Science, Process automations and App development.

My strenghts are SQL, Databases, LookML and vizualisations in most of the Business Intelligence and Geo Information Systems tools but I also enjoy 
working on improving my Python and R programming, ETL and pipeline building skills as well.
