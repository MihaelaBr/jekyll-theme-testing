        <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Michaela, I seek to uncover the secrets of the data I work with and sometimes engineer 
          it's path and transformation to the vizualisation tools I use. My background is in managing technical 
          projects and working with geospatial data and maps. Excited about learning more and more about Data 
          and Web Analytics, Data Engineering and Data Science, Process automations and App development.</p>

        <p>In this Portfolio you can see a few of my data and vizualisation projects created around business 
          topics, some that have a special focus on the urban and natural environment, and also a few that 
          include personal interests like music and movies.
          My strenghts are SQL, Databases, LookML and vizualisations in most of the Business Intelligence
          and Geo Information Systems tools but I also enjoy working on improving my 
          Python programming, ETL and pipeline building skills as well. </p>
