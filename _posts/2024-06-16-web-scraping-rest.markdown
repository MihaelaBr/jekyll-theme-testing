description: This Web Scraping and Visualisations project was created using Python and Beautiful Soup and later visualised in Tableau using the data for museums from the official Zuerich.com webpage where you can find all tourist information for the city. The project was inspired by another webscraping project which mapped the Restaurants in Berlin.
