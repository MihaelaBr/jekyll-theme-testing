description: This was a small personal project inspired while exploring the vast dataset offerings in Kaggle. As a cinephile who watches many movies and tv series I was interested in learning what is good on Netflix and what is not so interesting based on IMDB scoring in different genres and organized by years. I also did an analysis on the famous actors represented in the dataset.
